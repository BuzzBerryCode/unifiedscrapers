# Daily Rescraping Scheduler - Verification & Status

## ✅ Current Status (After Distribution Fix)

### Distribution Fixed ✅
- **SQL distribution fix applied successfully**
- **Creators spread across 6 days**: ~292-293 creators per day
- **Schedule shows**: Wed(292), Thu(292), Fri(293), Sat(293), Sun(293), Mon(293)
- **No creators due today (Tuesday)** - correct, as they were updated yesterday

### Metrics Fixed ✅
- **Total Creators**: Shows actual count from database
- **Daily Average**: Now calculates properly (~292 creators/day)
- **Due Today**: Shows creators due TODAY (0 today, 292 tomorrow)
- **Debug tools removed**: Clean interface

## 🚀 How Daily Scheduler Works

### Automatic Daily Jobs
1. **Scheduler runs every minute** checking for 9:00 AM UTC
2. **At 9:00 AM UTC daily**: Creates job for creators due that day
3. **Finds creators updated exactly 7 days ago** + any with null dates
4. **Creates "daily_rescrape" job** with all due creators
5. **Stores creator list in Redis** for processing
6. **Starts job immediately** if no other jobs running

### Tomorrow's Schedule (Wednesday)
- **292 creators due** (updated last Wednesday)
- **Job will be created at 9:00 AM UTC**
- **Will appear in main dashboard** as active job
- **Will process all 292 creators** automatically

## 🔧 Key Functions

### `create_daily_rescraping_job()`
- Finds creators due today (updated exactly 7 days ago)
- Includes creators with null updated_at dates
- Prevents duplicate jobs (checks for existing daily job)
- Creates job with proper status (PENDING/QUEUED)

### `run_daily_scheduler()`
- Background thread running continuously
- Checks every minute for 9:00 AM UTC
- Calls `create_daily_rescraping_job()` at the right time
- Sleeps 2 minutes after creating job to avoid duplicates

### Job Processing
- Uses existing `rescrape_all_creators()` function
- Processes creators from Redis data
- Updates progress in real-time
- Handles both Instagram and TikTok creators

## 📊 Expected Tomorrow (Wednesday, Aug 27th)

### At 9:00 AM UTC:
1. ✅ Scheduler detects it's 9:00 AM
2. ✅ Finds 292 creators due (updated Aug 20th)
3. ✅ Creates daily_rescrape job
4. ✅ Job appears on main dashboard
5. ✅ Processing begins automatically

### Job Details:
- **Job Type**: `daily_rescrape`
- **Total Items**: 292 creators
- **Description**: "Daily rescrape - 292 creators due (2025-08-27)"
- **Status**: PENDING → RUNNING → COMPLETED
- **Processing Time**: ~30-45 minutes (2-3 seconds per creator)

## 🛡️ Error Handling & Safeguards

### Duplicate Prevention
- Checks for existing daily job before creating new one
- Uses date-based filtering to prevent multiple jobs per day

### Graceful Degradation
- If Redis fails, job still created in database
- If scheduler thread crashes, it restarts automatically
- If job fails, it can be resumed manually

### Monitoring
- All actions logged to console
- Job progress visible in dashboard
- Failed creators tracked and reported

## 🎯 Verification Checklist

- ✅ Distribution fixed (6 days, ~292 each)
- ✅ Metrics showing correct values
- ✅ Debug tools removed
- ✅ Daily scheduler running (background thread)
- ✅ Job creation logic tested
- ✅ Processing logic handles daily_rescrape jobs
- ✅ Frontend displays jobs correctly

## 🚨 What to Watch Tomorrow

1. **At 9:00 AM UTC**: Check if daily job appears
2. **Job Progress**: Should show 292 creators processing
3. **Completion**: Should finish in ~30-45 minutes
4. **Next Day**: Thursday should show 292 creators due

## 🔧 Manual Override (If Needed)

If automatic scheduler fails, you can manually trigger:

```bash
# Via API
POST /rescraping/schedule-daily
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Or use the "Daily Rescrape (Recommended)" button on the rescraping page.
